# Coverage's environment-sensitive tests

The `--min`/`--min-file` floors `--make coverage` is invoked with
encode **which lines execute**, and that depends on the machine. Two of
CI's heaviest complications exist to hold those inputs still:

- the **digest-pinned container** (#734) — an OS image roll moved the
  floor (#722's churn), so the image became a pin;
- the **non-root builder** in every lane — tests skip differently as
  root, so *identity* became a pinned build input too.

Both treatments are correct. The shape worth noticing is that an
environment-sensitive metric forced CI to pin the environment twice, and
each newly discovered sensitivity adds another pin. The structural fixes
(skip-aware coverage; flooring on the cross-lane intersection) are
recorded below. This file is the
cheap half that is worth having regardless: **an inventory, so the next
floor churn is diagnosable in minutes instead of rediscovered.**

Keep it current. A test that skips on a condition the host controls
belongs here the day it is written.

## What varies, and what it moves

| condition | tests | effect on coverage |
|---|---|---|
| **euid == 0** | `cosmic/fs/walk_test.tl` skips its EACCES path — root can traverse an unreadable directory, so the error branch is unreachable | `cosmic/fs/walk.tl`'s permission-error lines. This is the sensitivity the non-root builder exists for, and it was folklore until now |
| **Landlock available** (Linux ≥ 5.13, and not already restricted by an outer sandbox) | `cosmic/landlock_test.tl`, `cosmic/unveil_test.tl`, `cosmic/sandbox_test.tl`, `_cli/fence_test.tl` | `cosmic/landlock.tl`, `cosmic/unveil.tl`, `cosmic/sandbox.tl`, and `_cli/driver.tl`'s fence path. The enforce lane is where these actually run |
| **pledge available** | `cosmic/pledge_test.tl` — note it skips in BOTH directions: the fail-closed path is unexercisable where pledge works, and the success path where it does not | `cosmic/pledge.tl` |
| **Linux namespaces** (`unshare`, uid_map writes, capabilities) | `cosmic/quicksand/**` — `proc_test` alone carries 17 skips, plus `box/run_test`, `caps_test`, `netns_test`, `proxy_test`, `init_test` | all of `cosmic/quicksand/**`. The largest single block, and the reason those files' floors are low |
| **a real tty** | `cosmic/tty_test.tl`, `cosmic/tty_pty_test.tl` | `cosmic/tty.tl`. Neither stdin nor stdout is a tty under make, so the interactive branches never run in any lane |
| **the network / a free port** | `cosmic/net/connect_test.tl`, `cosmic/net/init_test.tl`, `cosmic/quicksand/proxy/serve_test.tl` | `cosmic/net/**`. The offline lane deliberately runs with only loopback |
| **fork available** | `cosmic/quicksand/proxy/serve_test.tl`, `cosmic/child/init_test.tl` | the child/proxy paths that need a second process |
| **unveil/landlock available** for `cosmic/unveil.tl` specifically | none — this is about which BRANCHES run, not which tests | the two hosts cover different halves. Where unveil is unavailable (this container: `landlock_create_ruleset` is ENOSYS) every entry point returns early through its fail-closed guard and those lines are covered; where it IS available the guards are skipped and the bodies are covered instead. Neither host covers both, and the `keep_coverage` path is reachable only through the unveil backend, which is the non-Linux one — so Linux CI cannot cover it at all |
| **the make engine present** (`check.needs`) | every `_make` graph test | all of `_make/**`. Unlike the rows above this one HARD-FAILS in CI rather than skipping — a graph-test surface that silently becomes green skips is the failure that closed |
| **which compiler built the artifact** | any module a test loads out of the binary under test (`/zip/**`) | its `total` line count, not just its covered count. Coverage attributes an embedded chunk to its tree source but counts executable lines in the *compiled* copy that ran — and CI's binary is built by the PIN's compiler while a developer's is built by its own. `_make/graph.tl` measures 271 executable lines here and 210 there. Floors for these rows come from CI |

## Reading a floor that moved

1. Compare the `missing:` line in `o/coverage-summary.txt` against this
   table before assuming a regression. A block of newly-missing lines in
   one of the files above is an environment change, not a code change.
2. `check.skip` messages go to the test's `.err`, so
   `grep -h SKIP o/coverage/**/*.test.err` says what the run actually
   skipped. That is the fastest confirmation.
3. Only then look at the diff.

The floors are deliberately **conservative** — most are well under what
a full lane achieves, because the numbers gate a whole tree, not a
single row's snapshot. Do not raise `--min`/`--min-file` in
`.github/workflows/pr.yml` to match a number only your machine
measured: the environment-sensitive rows above are exactly the ones a
laptop under-measures, and a change that raises the floor to fit a
friendlier host bakes that host's ceiling into everyone's gate. Move
the two numbers only from CI's own measurement, and read this file
first when either one refuses.

## Why this file exists

Coverage's environment-sensitivity is the root of CI's pinning. Two
of CI's heaviest complications exist to hold the coverage ratchet's
inputs still: the digest-pinned container (an OS image roll moved the
floor) and the non-root builder in every lane (tests skip differently as
root). Both treatments are correct given the ratchet's design. The shape
to notice is that an environment-sensitive metric forced CI to pin the
environment *twice*, and each newly discovered sensitivity adds another
pin.

Options, none free:

1. **Skip-aware coverage** — exclude lines inside a test that reported
   skip (status 2) from the denominator, so a skipped path moves no
   floor. Requires the collector to know test boundaries; it may
   already, via the per-test `.got` contract. This is the structural
   fix if the data supports it.
2. **Floor on the intersection** — ratchet against lines covered in
   *every* lane, so environment-variable lines fall out by
   construction. Costs cross-lane aggregation.
3. **Accept and document** — keep the pins and add the missing half: a
   recorded inventory of known environment-sensitive tests, so the next
   floor churn is diagnosable in minutes instead of rediscovered. Cheap,
   and worth doing regardless of 1 and 2. The inventory lives in
   this file.
