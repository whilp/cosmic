# Decisions

architecture decision records for the tradeoffs behind
[goals.md](../goals.md). each entry records what was decided, what was
rejected, and why — so future work (human or agent) does not relitigate
them by accident. the rejected options are the point: an alternative
listed without the reason it lost is an invitation to try it again.

**format:** one record per file, `d<NN>-<slug>.md`, taking the next free
number — never reused, never renumbered. the first line is
`# D<n> — <title>`, then a header block (`date`, `status`) and four
sections: context → decision → rejected → consequences.

**a record's state** is its `status` header, and it is one of three:

| status | meaning |
|---|---|
| `active` | stands as written |
| `amended <YYYY-MM>` | the decision stands; a fact under it moved, and a final `amended` bullet says what |
| `superseded by D<n>` | the call was reversed by a later record |

a merged record's body is never rewritten to look right in hindsight:
an amendment is appended, a reversal is a **new** record that names the
one it replaces, and nothing is ever deleted — a recorded dead end is
the most useful thing here. amending a decision is allowed; doing so
silently is not.

**to add or amend one:** the method is `skills/decide` — when a
tradeoff earns a record, how to write each section, and how to audit
existing ones. the process itself is a decision, recorded in
[D26](d26-decision-records.md). after writing, run
`bin/cosmic _docs/derive.tl` to rewrite the table below; it is derived
from every record's H1 and status, and `_build/docs_test.tl` fails the
build when the committed copy drifts.
