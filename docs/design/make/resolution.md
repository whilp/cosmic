# Module resolution

Which bytes answer `require("x.y")` in a process the build spawns.

The [model](model.md) says *import path = path relative to root*, and
the graph compiles every source to `o/<path>.lua`. Neither sentence is
about run time, and nothing else in the design is either — so what a
spawned child actually loads is whatever `package.path` happens to say.
Measured, it is never the thing the build just produced.

## What happened before this landed

`package.path` inside any cosmic artifact, in order:

```
/zip/?.lua  /zip/?/init.lua          the generated entry wrapper prepends this
/zip/?.lua  /zip/?/init.lua          cmd/cosmic/main.tl inserts it again
/zip/.lua/?.lua  /zip/.lua/?/init.lua    cosmopolitan's own
./?.lua  ./?/init.lua                cwd
```

then `cosmic.searcher`, appended last, which resolves `./x/y.tl` and
compiles it **lax**. So a require resolves, in order, to:

1. the **running binary's** copy of the module, if it embeds one
2. a committed `.lua` in the tree
3. the tree's `.tl` **source**, lax-compiled

`o/` appears nowhere. The build's output is unreachable by name, and
which of the three you get depends on whether the binary you happen to
be running ships a module with that import path.

## Three failures, each reproduced

**A generator silently produces stale output.** `_types/types_gen.tl`
is a generation unit and is not embedded, so it loads from the tree —
but `_types/gentype_render.tl` *is* embedded, so it loads from `/zip`.
One generator, two generations of code. Editing the renderer and
building once:

```
$ sed -i '335s|GENERATED from|GENERATED-MARKER-XYZ from|' \
    _types/gentype_render.tl
$ o/bin/cosmic --make build && head -2 o/_types/types_gen/cosmo.d.tl
-- GENERATED from cosmopolitan's definitions.lua by _types/gentype.tl.   # stale
$ o/bin/cosmic --make build && head -2 o/_types/types_gen/cosmo.d.tl
-- GENERATED-MARKER-XYZ from cosmopolitan's definitions.lua by …         # second build
```

The first pass produces stale output and reports `build: PASS`. Nobody
had to type the command twice, and saying so was the imprecise part of
this analysis before the measurement below: `--make build` in a project
that builds its own toolchain SELF-converges, so the second pass came
from [converge](../../../_make/converge.tl) re-execing into the binary
it had just built. The cost was a wasted pass and a wrong pass-1
output, not a second command — and converge was silently supplying the
repair, which is the worst place for a repair to live.

**A test never runs what the graph compiled.** The `deps_*` machinery
computes each test's transitive closure as *built* paths, makes them
prerequisites, and passes them as `--deps` so the fence can grant them.
The test then loads something else. In a user project
(`_make/testdata/pkg`, with a test that prints
`debug.getinfo(greet.hi, "S").source`):

```
LOADED FROM: @./greet/init.tl
```

not `o/greet/init.lua`, which was built, listed and granted. In this
repo, the same probe under `--make test`:

```
_make.project <- @/zip/_make/project.lua
cosmic.fs     <- @/zip/cosmic/fs/path.lua
```

So cosmic's tests test the **binary's** modules and a user's tests test
**lax-compiled source**; neither tests the strict-compiled bytes that
ship. `deps_*` schedules and fences a set of files nothing opens.

The cost has a second half: a user project compiles every module
**twice** — once strict into `o/`, which nothing loads, and once lax
through the searcher, which is what runs. The lax half is content-hash
cached and the cache is SHARED (`cosmic/_script_cache.tl`'s `cache_dir`
reads `COSMIC_TL_CACHE_DIR`, then `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, then `TMPDIR`, and
`record` sets none of them — so it lands at `/tmp/cosmic-tl-cache-<uid>`
for every step; measured, 378 entries after one gate). So the waste is
one compile of the tree per content+build, not one per run — but it is
still a whole second compilation of every module, in the mode that is
not the one shipped.

**The perf harness measures the binary, not the tree.** `_perf/harness`
and every `_perf/bench/*` are embedded, so:

```
$ o/bin/cosmic _perf/run.tl … _perf.bench.json_bench     # tree entry
$ o/bin/cosmic o/_perf/run.lua …                         # the guide's form
_perf.harness <- @/zip/_perf/harness.lua                 # both
```

Edit `_perf/harness.tl` or a scenario, re-run either command, and
nothing changes. `o/_perf/harness.lua` is sitting right there, built
and never loaded. `skills/optimize/SKILL.md` already warns that a benchmark
"cannot tell you it read the wrong subject"; this is that trap one
level down, below where naming `$BIN` can reach.

**And there was no escape hatch.** The old Makefile had one —
`tree_lua_path`, an opt-in `LUA_PATH` per lane. `cmd/cosmic/main.tl`
still documented inserting the zip root "BEHIND anything `LUA_PATH`
set", but the generated entry wrapper (`cosmic/embed/init.tl`,
`WRAP_MAIN`) prepends it unconditionally one frame earlier, so
`LUA_PATH` could not reach ahead of `/zip` at all, and `TREE_LUA_PATH`
survived in `_cli/build/steps.tl` with nothing setting it.

That wrapper is **correct** and stays: an artifact answers for itself.
Both pieces of dead intent went with this change — the comment and the
`TREE_LUA_PATH` branch — because the channel is `--modules`, not the
environment.

## The rule

> **In a project, the tree answers. Outside one, the binary does.**

Precedence for a child the engine spawns:

1. the **build closure** — the exact files the graph produced for this
   target
2. the rest of the **build directory** — what the graph built for
   imports outside this target's closure
3. the rest of the **tree**, compiled strictly by `cosmic.searcher`
4. the running binary's payload (`/zip/**`)
5. cosmopolitan's own (`/zip/.lua/**`)

Layers 1–3 are the same answer at different costs: 1 and 2 are what the
graph already built, so they are a cache and a freshness guarantee, not
a separate semantics. Deleting `o/` changes how long a require takes and
not what it returns. That is what makes the rule one sentence instead of
a table.

Layer 2 is not an optimisation anybody guessed at. Without it every
child strict-compiled the dispatcher's own modules from source, because
they are outside any single test's closure: **2.3 s for one probe test
against 5 ms**, measured, and paid per child. Every verb that runs the
project's own code compiles the whole tree first (`prepare_stage`), so
the files are there and current; a manifest pointed by hand at an `o/`
nobody built is outside the freshness the closure already assumes.

**Layer 3 is strict**, and that is what earns it its position. A lax
compile ahead of the binary's checked bytes would mean position
deciding which of two compile modes you got; strict makes the layers
agree by construction, so "the tree wins" costs nothing but time.

**Strict here means type errors, not warnings.** A module that does not
type-check is not one to run, so a type error fails the `require` — that
is the half that keeps tree-first from being a downgrade from the
binary's already-checked bytes. Warnings pass. `werror` is `--check
types`'s contract, and inheriting it would turn a shadowed local into a
runtime failure of whatever happened to require the file first, in a
project whose gate would have said so plainly. The gate stays the gate.

An artifact running as *itself* keeps today's order exactly. That is
not a compromise; it is the other half of the same rule. A built binary
must answer from its own zip no matter what the environment says —
`_make/artifact_test.tl` names its child's environment rather than
inheriting it precisely so an artifact test cannot be answered by the
checkout that built it. Which is why the mechanism below is **not**
`LUA_PATH`.

## The closure is already in the line

`--deps` already carries the transitive import closure, as built paths,
on every test, example, benchmark and coverage recipe. `_make/deps.tl`
computes it, and its own doc comment says why it is one function: "Two
things want this answer" — the graph, for scheduling, and the fence,
for grants.

Make it three. Cosmic builds `import path -> file` from those same
paths and installs it as a searcher ahead of everything else. Nothing
new is declared, nothing is configured, and the argument positions stay
the declaration.

An explicit map rather than a path prefix, for three reasons that are
all consequences of the design already in place:

- **exact** — a prefix over `o/` also offers `o/x.tl.test.got`,
  `o/.coverage/**` and every other build dropping in the mirror. A map
  offers what the graph built and nothing else.
- **already fresh** — make made those exact files before the recipe
  ran. There is no window where a stale `o/` wins, because the
  prerequisites are the map.
- **already fenced** — the paths *are* the read grants, so resolution
  cannot reach what the fence denies.

**The channel is `--modules <manifest>`.** `--deps` is stripped before
the child is spawned (a test that read `arg[1]` would otherwise find its
own dependency list there), so the closure reaches the child as a file
written beside the step's own output — inside the write grant it already
has — and named on the command line. Three line kinds:

```
root  <absolute project root>
build <build directory, relative to the root>
mod   <import.path> <built file>
```

The flag is scanned **by hand at the top of the dispatcher, before its
first require**. A module already in `package.loaded` is never searched
again, so anything required before the install would be pinned to the
binary's copy whatever the manifest said — and a test of `_cli.args`
would test `/zip`'s. `cosmic.searcher` is the one module that stays the
binary's, which is why it reads the manifest with `io.open` rather than
`cosmic.fs`: the pinned surface is exactly one module and nothing under
it.

**It travels in argv and does not inherit.** Ten `_make/*_test.tl`
files spawn a cosmic against a *different* project root under `/tmp`.
Carried in the environment, this repo's `o/` would answer `cosmic.*`
and `_make.*` while those children built unrelated projects — an
ambient-export bug class, which is why the closure travels in argv
instead.
`--deps` is per-invocation by construction, so there is nothing to
scrub. A child that spawns a child and wants the same resolution passes
it on deliberately.

## What layer 2 costs, and what the fence has to say

Layer 2 fires for imports no closure names, which is exactly the class
`_make/deps.tl` calls out: "A computed require is invisible there, and
the consequence is a denied read rather than only a missing rule."
`_perf/run.tl`'s `load_module` is that case in this repo —
`pcall(require, name)` with `name` off argv, which is how every
`_perf/bench/*_bench.tl` scenario loads. Under layer 3 alone the
flagship case comes out half-fixed: the harness resolves from the tree
and the scenario still comes from `/zip`, silently.

So the fence has to grant reads it did not derive. For a **test** it
already does — `_cli/grants.tl` gives `record` `ro = "."`, the whole
project, with the reasons written down there. For `run` and for the
generator pre-pass below, the same call has to be made explicitly
rather than inherited by accident.

## Three cases the closure does not cover by itself

**Source generators run before the graph.** A `*_gen.tl` writes build
*inputs*, so it runs before anything is compiled and has no built
closure to resolve through. The answer is a **mini-graph**: compile each
generator's closure strictly into `o/` first, then run the generator
against those built paths. Uniform with everything else — nothing the
build runs is unchecked at the moment it runs — and `_make/generate.tl`
already spawns these itself, so there is no recipe to change. The
compile goes through the graph's own `compile` step rather than a second
spelling of it; `--compile-strict --output` is that second spelling, and
it writes to stdout unless *both* flags are given.

Two measurements say the cost is affordable and the ordering works:

- `srcdeps__types/types_gen` is **20 files of 375**. A pre-pass over
  generator closures is a fraction of the tree, not the graph again.
- **no circularity.** Removing `o/_types/types_gen/` and strict-compiling
  `_types/gentype.tl` succeeds: the include path falls back to the
  binary's bundled `/zip/.types`. So a generator that produces the
  type declarations can be compiled without them, on a cold tree.

That fallback is itself an instance of the theme this chapter is about —
a cold build bootstraps its types through the running binary's copy —
and it is the one place where that is load-bearing rather than
accidental. It should be stated in `model.md`'s generator section rather
than left to be discovered.

**Payload generators run after compile**, so `embed_gen.tl` takes a
built closure like a test. Its closure is the binary's scope, which the
model already defines.

**A human at a shell has no closure at all.** This is what `run` is for
— **paths only**:

```
cosmic --make run <path> [args…]    # build, then run this source against the tree
```

`test`'s shape with a different contract: build the closure, spawn with
that closure as the resolution set. It is what `_perf` wants —

```
cosmic --make run _perf/run.tl --out o/perf/current.json
```

— and it retires the "measures whatever `o/` happens to hold" warning
from `skills/optimize/SKILL.md` by construction: the run is what makes `o/`
fresh. `_docs/publish.tl`, invoked from `docs.yml` as a bare tree
script, is the other caller: it imports no siblings so nothing is stale
today, but it is correct only for as long as `bin/cosmic` happens to
resolve to a current `o/bin/cosmic`.

**This amends [verbs.md](verbs.md)**, whose entry reads `run [binary]
build, then exec the artifact with remaining argv`. The binary form has
no caller: `o/bin/<name>` is already executable, so it buys a rebuild
and two saved tokens, while the source form is what all six broken
commands in this repo need. `run <name>` becomes a refusal that names
`o/bin/<name>`; the `go run ./cmd/foo` ergonomic waits for a project
that asks for it, under a word chosen then.

## Precedence against the standard library

If a project **claims** a namespace — it defines `cosmic/init.tl`
outright — its own modules win over `/zip`'s in its own processes. If it
does not, `cosmic.*` always comes from the running binary and a project
cannot shadow a *piece* of the standard library.

**The searcher does not enforce that, and should not be credited with
it.** `tree_searcher` has no claims check: layers 1–3 resolve any name
the tree can spell. The property holds one step earlier — `_make`'s
`validate.check_reserved` refuses an unclaimed reserved import path
before anything is spawned, so a validated tree cannot contain a partial
`cosmic.*` shadow for the searcher to find. Same rule as
`cosmic/embed/floor.tl`'s `SUPERSEDABLE`, in a second place; the second
place is the validator's pre-flight, not run time.

The boundary that leaves, stated because it is reachable: `install_tree`
is public API on `cosmic.searcher`, and a hand-written manifest fed to
it — or `--modules` pointed at one — shadows any namespace with no
claims check at all. Fine for the engine, whose manifests only ever name
a validated project's closure. A footgun for anyone else who finds the
API, and an argument for either checking claims in `install_tree` or
saying plainly that the manifest is the engine's to write.

Stated plainly, because it is the sharp edge: in this repo that makes a
test of `cosmic.fs` run against the tree's `o/cosmic/fs/init.lua` rather than
the binary's — which is what you want, and is also how a broken
`cosmic.fs` breaks the thing running the test. It is bounded by being
per-child: the engine keeps running on its own payload, and only the
spawned test sees the tree.

## What it does to the fixpoint

`converge` answers *which binary gates the tree*. This answers *which
bytes a spawned child requires*. They compose, and the second shrinks
the first's job: with the tree resolving first, generation 1 already
runs the tree's generators, the tree's tests, and the tree's modules.

What still needs a second generation is code running *inside* the
gating binary before it spawns anything — the dispatcher, the rules
file, the artifact packer. So **converge stays**, and the release
loop's second `--make build` stays with it. The expectation is that
generation 2 stops changing bytes in the common case; that is a
measurement to take after this lands, not a claim to make before.

## The fixpoint, measured

The measurement this chapter deferred, taken after landing. Same
protocol both sides: warm to a tree-built binary, edit
`_types/gentype_render.tl` (a generator's helper the artifact embeds),
then pin **exactly one pass** with `COSMIC_MAKE_GEN=2` so converge
cannot supply a second.

| tree | output after one pass |
|---|---|
| `a6688d7`, before | `-- GENERATED from …` — **stale** |
| `b39d961`, after | `-- FIXPOINT-PROBE from …` — **current** |

And afterwards, a freely-converging build is one pass that changes
**zero bytes**. So generation 2 no longer changes the answer.

**Converge stays, and its trigger is unchanged**: re-exec when the built
artifact differs from the running binary. What changed is its ROLE. It
was load-bearing for correctness — pass 1 could emit stale payload that
pass 2 repaired — and it is now confirmation. The release loop's second
`--make build` is a check rather than a requirement by the same
argument.

What still needs a second generation is the boundary this chapter
already drew: code running INSIDE the gating binary before it spawns
anything. The dispatcher, the artifact packer, and the `compile` step's
own `cosmic.teal` all load from `/zip`, because a recipe step is a fresh
cosmic with no manifest. Change one of those and pass 1 builds with the
old one. That is why the cap is 2 rather than 1, and why it is not 1.

**A note on measuring this.** The obvious experiment — clean build from
the pin, hash, build again, hash — reports IDENTICAL on both sides and
proves nothing. From a cold pin both sides converge by re-exec, so the
end states agree and only the pass COUNT differs. Any future check here
has to pin the generation.

## The gates

Each claim above has a test, and each reads a
`debug.getinfo(f, "S").source` — the only thing that answers "which
bytes ran" without trusting the thing under test to report on itself.

- `_make/resolution_test.tl` — a fixture project's test loads
  `o/greet/init.lua`, not `./greet/init.tl`; `run` resolves a computed
  require inside the project; `run` passes argv and the target's exit
  code through; a build spawned from a test resolves against *its own*
  root, never the outer one.
- `_make/generate_test.tl` — a generator's helper whose import path
  COLLIDES with one the binary embeds resolves to the tree. The
  collision is the whole test: a fixture module with a name cosmic does
  not ship can only ever come from the tree, so a fixture that does not
  shadow passes before and after and proves nothing. Verified against
  a pre-change binary, which answers `ZIP` where this answers `TREE`.
- `cosmic/searcher_tree_test.tl` — the layers one at a time, plus the
  edges an end-to-end test cannot reach: a manifest with no root, a
  missing one, a closure entry naming a file that is not there (loud,
  not a fall-through to `/zip`), a type error failing a require, and a
  warning not failing one.
- `_cli/build/modules_test.tl` — the manifest format, and the
  build-directory constant agreeing with the model's.
- `_make/artifact_test.tl`, unchanged and still passing: a built
  artifact resolves from its own zip and ignores an ambient `LUA_PATH`.

Note what moved in `.cosmic-coverage` (the committed coverage floor at
the time; a command-line `--min`/`--min-file` pair since) and why:
several files' *total* coverable lines changed without their sources
changing
(`_make/project.tl` 221 → 193, `cosmic/check.tl` 92 → 113). That is the
change working. Those totals were measured against the binary's
embedded copies; they are now measured against what the graph built.

## Settled

1. **`run` takes paths only.** The binary form is dropped; `verbs.md` is
   amended.
2. **Source generators get a compile-first mini-graph**, straight away —
   not a lax source closure.
3. **The closure travels in argv and does not inherit.** `LUA_PATH` is
   not the channel and is not restored; `WRAP_MAIN`'s prepend is correct
   for artifact identity and stays. `cmd/cosmic/main.tl`'s "BEHIND
   anything `LUA_PATH` set" comment and the `TREE_LUA_PATH` branch in
   `_cli/build/steps.tl` are dead intent and go with this change.
4. **The tree outranks the binary, closure or not**, and in-tree
   compilation is **strict** — which is what makes 4 safe, and what
   makes the closure a cache rather than a semantics.

## Settled

- **Strict does not apply to the entry script.**
  The searcher only sees REQUIRED modules, so a hand-run `cosmic
  foo.tl` keeps the lax on-ramp `cosmic.teal`'s own doc comment
  promises, even inside a project. The alternative — strict inside a
  project, lax outside — is a second rule keyed on "which project am I
  in", the ambiguity `_make/root.tl` refuses to guess about, and it
  would silently revoke the on-ramp for anyone running a script from a
  directory that happens to be a project. `cosmic/searcher.tl`'s
  header carries the same statement where the code lives.

## Open
- **Where the fence draws the line for `run` and the generator
  pre-pass.** A test already reads `.` and the reasons are written down
  in `_cli/grants.tl`. `run` and the mini-graph inherit that today
  rather than having had the call made for them.
- **Whether the mini-graph's `/zip/.types` fallback should be loud.** It
  is the one sanctioned place a build reads the running binary's bytes
  instead of the tree's, and a silent sanctioned exception is how the
  rest of this chapter's failures got in.

- **How deep a fenced build nests.** Found while writing the gates and
  recorded rather than dropped: a `--make` build run from a test that is
  itself run by a nested `--make test` — four levels of `record`, each
  intersecting its parent's Landlock policy — fails in CI with `No rule
  to make target`, while the same build passes standalone and passes
  locally where Landlock does not enforce. Three levels is what
  `_make/fixtures_test.tl` and `_make/build_test.tl` already do and they
  are green, so the limit sits between. The non-inheritance gate asserts
  the mechanism at two levels instead — a grandchild inheriting the
  parent's whole environment still resolves from source, not from the
  parent's build — which is the property that was actually in question.
  The depth ceiling is a fence question and wants its own change.
