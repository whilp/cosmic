# cosmic.mk — the rules for `cosmic --make`.
#
# This file is CONSTANT. It ships inside the cosmic binary and is
# byte-identical for every project: nothing here is generated, and no
# rule is ever emitted per project. What varies is o/project.mk, which
# holds only variable assignments — the file lists cosmic's own walk
# and validator produced. Codegen is therefore "emit a list of
# variables", while discovery and validation stay in Teal, where an
# error can name a path and say what is wrong with it.
#
# Every recipe line is whitespace-split argv whose first word is a
# cosmic verb, run through `cosmic -c`. No quoting, no expansion, no
# pipes, no redirects — the build's entire capability surface is that
# vocabulary. The trailing `;` on each line is load-bearing: make
# execs a line it judges shell-free itself, without consulting SHELL,
# so a line with no metacharacter would never reach cosmic at all.
# `-c` strips exactly one trailing sentinel; a `;` anywhere else is
# still refused.

include o/project.mk

SHELL := $(COSMIC)

# Secondary expansion, declared before the first rule that needs it: a
# prerequisite written `$$(srcdeps_$$*)` resolves on the second pass,
# once the stem is known. It is what lets rules that never change name a
# per-target variable the facts file computed.
.SECONDEXPANSION:

# Not every verb leaves a no-op target's mtime alone -- only three
# things actually do: `write-list` and the makefiles (`o/project.mk`,
# via `write_if_changed`) skip the write entirely when the bytes match,
# and the ARTIFACT itself is swapped in only when it differs
# (`replace_if_changed`), so an unchanged binary never invalidates the
# tree that depends on the tool that built it. Most recipe steps
# (`compile`, `capture`, via `run_into`) instead restamp the target's
# mtime even when the bytes are unchanged -- deliberately, so a target
# make judged out of date does not stay out of date forever -- and
# `tee`/`copy` write unconditionally. Convergence rests on the
# artifact, not on every intermediate staying untouched.
#
# Every graph rule names a TOOL STAMP — `$(O)/.stamp/<tool>`, written
# by materialize before make runs — because a result is only as fresh
# as the tool that produced it: a formatter fix must invalidate every
# `.fmt.got`, or a whole tree reports clean against the formatter it
# replaced. The stamp is a hash of the embedded bytes that run when
# the rule's verb runs (see _make/stamp.tl), NOT the binary itself:
# the binary embeds every module, so naming it invalidated the whole
# graph on any edit anywhere, and made each build's replaced artifact
# re-run the world once more to prove nothing changed.
.DELETE_ON_ERROR:

# ...except the summaries, which are PHONY instead.
#
# A summary's recipe exits nonzero BECAUSE its stage failed, so
# `.DELETE_ON_ERROR` deleted exactly the artifact a consumer opens
# next -- a CI step, `ci` grading its own stages, a person reading `o/`
# after the fact.
#
# `.PRECIOUS` looks like the fix and is a worse bug: make's
# `delete_target` does return early for a precious file, so the summary
# survives -- with a mtime NEWER than the `.got` files it reports on.
# make then calls it up to date and never runs `--report` again, so the
# stage's failure is never re-reported and the verdict reads a stale
# summary forever. Verified both ways against real make.
#
# Phony gets both properties from one word: `delete_target` returns
# early for a phony file too, and a phony target's recipe always runs.
# A summary is a REPORT over targets that already exist -- reading a
# handful of `.got` files -- so always-fresh is what it should have
# been. `tee` writes the summary unconditionally every run (it does not
# compare against the existing file), which is fine precisely because
# the target is phony: nothing depends on the summary's mtime for
# freshness, only on the `.got` files it reads.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- build

compiled := $(patsubst %.tl,$(O)/%.lua,$(tl_sources))
staged := $(patsubst %,$(O)/%,$(lua_sources))

## Compile every source into $(O)
build: compile
compile: $(compiled) $(staged)

# Strict: --compile-strict type checks and generates from that same
# checked AST, so nothing lands in $(O) that the checker rejected.
# `--include-dir .` is what makes the project root the module root —
# require("pkg.db") resolves to pkg/db.tl and nowhere else.
#
# srcdeps is what makes "strict" mean anything incrementally. A strict
# compile checks against the SOURCES it imports, so a module whose
# contract changed must recompile its importers; without these
# prerequisites the incremental build happily kept output a clean build
# rejects. They are also passed in the line, so the fence grants the
# compiler its own source plus what it imports -- and not the `.`
# include path, which is where it SEARCHES, not what it reads.
#
# $(O)/_types/types_gen.stamp is the same hazard one layer down: every
# compile resolves `cosmo.*` (and `tl`) through o/_types/types_gen on
# its include path, but that directory is generated, not a listed
# source -- so without this prerequisite a cosmos pin bump left every
# already-compiled file's mtime alone and an unchanged file kept
# checking against types the LAST pin left. The stamp is
# content-addressed (`_make.generate`'s stamp_types), so a run that
# regenerates byte-identical declarations does not move its mtime and
# a no-op build stays a no-op.
# The two stamps ride in the line as well as the prerequisite list:
# everything after --deps is an INPUT -- granted by the fence, keyed by
# the step's content skip (_cli/build/work.tl), never forwarded to the
# child. A line that declares its inputs is one the step can prove it
# already ran.
# One step per DIRECTORY: the group stamp's recipe compiles every
# member in one process, so the boot, the compiler, and every checked
# import are paid once per group instead of once per file (#1099;
# decision record on the issue). Members keep their own content-keyed
# `.in` records — the same records the per-file rule writes, so the two
# paths interchange — and every member the batch verifies or compiles
# is restamped, which is what lets the per-file rule below self-skip on
# fresh mtimes and remain the correctness safety net rather than the
# hot path. Downstream rules keep their per-file mtime prerequisites;
# the record step's content skip absorbs the group restamps (d18).

# goes into the recipe line, feeding the derived fence -- but the fence
# grants a test read access to the whole project ("."), plus the
# runtime paths tests legitimately touch (ptys, /proc/self/fd, resolver
# files), not just what it imports: an import-only read grant did not
# survive contact with real tests (see `_cli/grants.tl`'s "record"
# case). What IS narrow is the write grant: only the test's own `.got`
# base and TMPDIR. One answer, two consumers: the argument positions
# are the declaration.
# Tests exec `$(testrun)`: with root `embed/` payload that is
# `o/.testrun/cosmic` — this cosmic plus the payload at its artifact
# paths, assembled before the graph runs — so `/zip/R` resolves inside
# a test exactly as inside the artifact. Without payload it is
# `$(COSMIC)` and `testrun_dep` is empty: the d17 rule against naming
# the binary as a prerequisite stands, while the runner file is
# content-addressed, so as a prerequisite it moves exactly when the
# toolchain or the payload did. A test declaring `--- env: NAME` also
# carries a hashed env stamp (`o/.env/<stem>.env`, `_make/envstamp.tl`)
